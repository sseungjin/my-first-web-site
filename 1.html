            >Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
          </a>
          is the standard markup language used for
          <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
          Alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS), it forms
          the triad of the World Wide Web (WWW). A web browser would typically
          receive HTML documents from either a web server or local storage.
          These documents are then rendered into multimedia web pages by the
          browser for viewing by a user and as such; one can say that these
          documents basically make up the structure of a web page semantically
          and originally, cues for the appearance of the document.
          <img src="webimage.jpg" width="100%" />
          Through the use of HTML elements, a web page can consist of various
          different entities ranging from images to interactive web forms. This
          is accomplished by denoting structural semantics for text such as
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and etc. These elements
          are identified by tags; angled brackets surrounding the keyword. For
          example, tags such as <img /> and <input /> are used to display
          content on the page while other tags such as
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          surrounded text but no tags are ever actually displayed by the browser
          as they're only used to interpret the page's contents. It should be
          noted that HTML can go a step further and allow developers to embed
          scripts into it such as JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets to
          further manipulate and define how the content appears.
